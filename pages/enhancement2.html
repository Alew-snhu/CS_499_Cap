                In week two of enhancements, I continued improving the Animal Monitoring System. 
                It was time to add some data structures and algorithms to give this program some
                functionality.
            </p>
            <p class ="para">
                <span style="font-weight:bolder">Justification of inclusion:</span><br>
                For week two, the initial plan was to convert the old java code into C#, take 
                the data collected from the algorithms and display it to the UI. This would 
                involve altering how I constructed the old java code and adding a few more steps 
                to get the data to display in the UI. I had to take a closer look and refresh 
                my memory on how this old code worked.<br><br>

                In the first step of this process, I display my skills in analyzing how code works 
                and creating modifications to fit a specific purpose. Within the program, there are 
                two functions to return the animal type and the description of the animal and store 
                it in an array. I decided to hold each data set within two different C# lists. I would 
                essentially take the two lists, utilize LINQ's .zip method to turn one list into 
                dictionary keys, and the other list into dictionary values, and use this dictionary to 
                provide functionality between a combo box and a list box in the UI. The functions 
                and the intended outcome can be seen in row one of the photos provided on the left 
                side of the page.<br><br>

                Another highlight of my skills in this week's enhancements would be the addition of 
                a test project within my solution. I created the test project to implement unit tests 
                on the view models. Passing tests on these view models would ensure that I have 
                complete code coverage and that my functions are doing what they are supposed to be.<br><br>

                The last part of my enhancements for this week would be refactoring the code for the 
                code behind files tied to the XAML UI files within the project. I wanted to implement 
                the Model View View Model architectural pattern to create a separation of concerns. 
                The MVVM architectural pattern would make it easier to split the project into smaller 
                pieces and make collaboration easier amongst team members. As you can see in row four 
                of the photos to the left, the logic is entirely removed from the code-behind files 
                and placed within its own view model files to achieve MVVM.

                A few key things that I learned throughout this week: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Setting up a test project and using the Xunit test library.</li>
                    <li>How to set up Visual Studio with multiple projects under one solution.</li>
                    <li>Advanced architectural patterns for separation of concerns.</li>
                    <li>Advanced LINQ methods.</li>
                </ul>
                I spent many hours learning new things and implementing them within the enhancements 
                this week. I have only read about many of the topics I mentioned in the justification 
                section and not done in an actual project, so everything was a learning experience. 
                The most exciting part of the enhancements for this week was learning about unit 
                testing with Xunit. Unit testing is a crucial part of software development. Knowing 
                how to write tests and test your code is a fundamental skill that every developer 
                needs to have.
