            The video to the left is an informal code review of the original Animal Monitoring System program on 
            which I based the full-stack application. In this code review, I walk through:            
        
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    The existing functionality of the program. I talk about what the code does and how it works.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    An analysis of the code, review the structure, look for efficiencies, and check for comments and code documentation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Planned enhancements for the full-stack application, which will be the final submission for the course. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            The code review effectively fulfills the course outcome to design, develop and deliver professional-quality 
            oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to 
            specific audiences and contexts. The code review demonstrates that I have the ability to think critically and
            present my thoughts to team members and project managers in an effective manner to accomplish business-specific 
            goals. A clear path can be organized by thinking critically about improvements to obtain those business-specific goals.
