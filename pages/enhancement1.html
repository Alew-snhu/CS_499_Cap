                The artifact I chose to enhance for the entirety of the course is the 
                Animal Monitoring System (AMS). The AMS was a small program completed 
                in IT-145: Foundation in Application Development. The program's primary
                purpose was to help zoo keepers keep track of animals and animal habitats
                in a zoo by parsing a text file and notifying them of the data within the text file.

                <span style="font-weight:bolder">Justification of inclusion:</span><br>
                As I was thinking about the artifacts I would enhance for this course, I revisited
                many of the old code files to get a better idea of what I would do for this 
                E-portfolio. I was reminded of the Animal Monitoring System program I completed 
                in my second year of college. After examining the old code files, I determined
                the AMS was an excellent candidate to be turned into a full-stack desktop 
                application. I Always wanted to create a Windows Presentation Application,
                so I combined the ideas and decided to turn it into a full-stack app.
                <br><br>
                Several of my abilities and skills are showcased within this enhancement 
                and are crucial to software design and engineering. Let me bring your attention
                to the photos on the left side of this page to add context to the skills
                demonstrated. The beginning stages of the enhancement included a lot of 
                time brainstorming how I would change and make this app more user-friendly
                than the original. 
                <br><br>
                The photos in the top row are wireframe designs created for the applications
                screens. I used this to plan and place the elements on each screen. The complete
                screens can be seen in row two and are not far from the wireframes. I also 
                needed to plan out how a user would navigate the application. In row three, 
                you can see the navigational layout for enhancement one and the completed 
                navigational design. Lastly, a flow chart is included to demonstrate how the
                algorithms will operate for the code to parse the text files, which will be 
                part of enhancement two.

                <span style="font-weight:bolder">Refelction:</span><br>
                Although I had prior experience creating and designing user interfaces, I
                did not have experience working with the UI elements within the context of
                a WPF application. After creating the project in Visual Studio, everything 
                was new from that point on. I spent every day learning how to create elements
                within a WPF application and use the XAML markup language that WPF uses exclusively 
                for its UI elements. One of the more challenging things I completed during the week 
                of this enhancement was learning how to have the user properly navigate the application. 
                After conducting a few hours of research, I figured out how to navigate the pages 
                with a button press, and at that point, everything was completed for the week.
