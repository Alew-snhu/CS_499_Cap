                In the final week of enhancements for the Animal Monitoring System, it 
                was time to add functionality for storing data within the application. 
                The original program did not interact with a database, so I had the 
                opportunity to brainstorm ways the user would store and retrieve data.

            <p class ="para">
                <span style="font-weight:bolder">Justification of inclusion:</span><br>
                In week three of enhancements, I had many tasks to complete before I could 
                call this project finished. My primary mission was to create a database for
                the AMS program and make it function. Another area in this project where I
                showcase my abilities is through research. Research is essential to any 
                developer's job, and I find it interesting to learn new things. I began 
                my week by researching SQLite as I thought this would be an excellent 
                decision for keeping the application lightweight. I  had previous experience 
                with SQLite in my Android programming course  I took in my third year of 
                college, so I was somewhat familiar with how it operated. I had also had 
                some experience with Entity Framework before starting this course, so I 
                thought maybe I could find a way to use both to make things much easier 
                for myself.<br><br>

                Although limited in features, I discovered Entity Framework Core supported
                SQLite through my research. After reading about all of the necessary Nuget
                packages I would need for an Entity Framework Core project, I was finally
                able to create one and start building the database. You can see the Entities 
                I created in the third row of photos to the left. The entities are C# classes 
                telling the database what kind of data will be stored in the table. I made a 
                class for the Animals, Habitats, and User Credentials, which all needed tables 
                in the database to store data. Next to the entities, you can see the DbSets, 
                which I would use to query for the data stored in the tables. Lastly, you can 
                see a code file of the DBseeder created to populate the database with the 
                animals already in the text file. The DBseeder was only made for the initial 
                setup of default values inside the database.<br><br>
                
                Aside from adding database functionality, I would also have to complete the 
                UI design for the database portion of the app. nine new screens were added 
                in this enhancement along with the code to make them all function. The 
                functionality of these screens would include adding, updating, and deleting 
                animal and habitat records in the database. I primarily used LINQ to query 
                for the information necessary to accomplish all of the functionality.<br><br>

                With the addition of new screens came the addition of new view models to house 
                the code for these screens. I added two new view models and ran many more tests 
                to ensure the code was doing what it was designed to do. Many application areas 
                needed refactoring after this, which would eventually take me to the end of the 
                week to complete.<br>

                <span style="font-weight:bolder">Refelction:</span><br>
                Week three was by far the busiest week I had regarding enhancements for this 
                project. I conducted a lot of research to complete most of this work because I 
                was unfamiliar with how exactly I would meet most of these tasks. I had a few 
                problems that took me a while to solve, but the most frustrating part was trying 
                to implement the data binding with the UI elements for this portion of the project. 
                I spent hours trying to figure out the correct way to use my view model properties 
                with the UI elements that used data from the database. After a few days of trial 
                and error, I finally reached out to a friend to help me solve the problem.<br><br>

                From creating the first UI element to creating the database, I have learned an 
                incredible amount about building full-stack applications. The knowledge throughout 
                this enhancement can be used and applied in a professional environment and to 
                my personal projects. I feel confident in saying I know much more than I did 
                three weeks ago when I started this project.<br>
