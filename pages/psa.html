            When I started the Computer Science program at SNHU, I had little knowledge of 
            what a software engineer did. I also had very little exposure to writing code 
            outside of a few HTML snippets I stumbled upon when I was a teenager. I have gained
            a solid understanding of what it means to be a software engineer throughout my 
            educational journey, and with each passing year, my skills and knowledge related
            to the field have increased significantly. Throughout the courses I experienced,
            I realized that I have a passion for engineering software. The artifact included
            will showcase the strengths I have acquired over the past four years, but some 
            skills I gained may not be entirely apparent from this artifact alone.
        </p>

        <p class="para2" >
                As I started getting into the core classes of the computer science degree, I began
            to gain crucial skills that I would need to utilize for working in team environments.
            In CS-310: Collaboration and Team Projects, I gained first-hand experience using 
            version control software such as Git. Git made it incredibly easy to collaborate
            on a massive coding project with an entire class. I learned valuable skills 
            related to communicating with team members and solving problems as a team in 
            this course that I can apply to a professional development team.
        </p>

        <p class="para2">
                Aside from communication with your team, another valuable lesson I learned is that 
            it is also essential to communicate with the project's stakeholders effectively. 
            In CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle, I learned about the software development
            lifecycle and the scrum framework. CS-250 was another valuable class in understanding
            the importance of communication within software development. Since the stakeholders
            are directly affected by the outcome of the software project, it is critical to 
            keep them informed about what is happening within the development process.
        </p>

        <p class="para2">
            After learning about how software development teams operate and the importance of 
            communication, many of my other courses focused on the fundamentals of coding and
            building software. In CS-260: Data Structures and Algorithms, I learned more about
            what an algorithm really is and how to implement them in my own programs. Many of
            the algorithms used in this course are used for sorting data and parsing CSV 
            spreadsheets. Within the Animal Monitoring System artifact included with this 
            e-portfolio, several different algorithms are used to parse text files, search 
            the database, and permit a user access to the application. The knowledge used to
            write those algorithms is based on the course material I learned in CS-260. The
            data structures used in the Animal Monitoring System are also based on the knowledge
            gained from this course.
        </p>

        <p class="para2">
            While algorithms and data structures are at the heart of every piece of software,
            it is crucial not to look past your application's engineering, database, and 
            security aspects. These aspects are demonstrated within the Animal Monitoring 
            System artifact included with this portfolio. I have taken several courses that
            expand on these topics in different ways, but a few notable ones gave me the 
            knowledge to take my skills to a higher level.
        </p>

        <p class="para2">
            CS-410: Reverse Software engineering taught me how to analyze the structure of a
            program and how to predict where security flaws may lie. DAD 220: Introduction 
            to SQL introduced me to the fundamentals of SQL and the importance of managing 
            your data wisely. Lastly, CS 405: Secure Coding taught me advanced secure coding
            techniques to prevent malicious users from hacking into my software. The skills
            I learned in these classes can be seen within the Animal Monitoring System's code.

        <h2>Artifact Summary</h2>
        <p class="para2">
            Within this e-Portfolio is the primary artifact created for the final project of 
            CS-499: Computer Science Capstone: The Animal Monitoring System. Although there 
            is only one artifact for this e-Portfolio, its work demonstrates and showcases my 
            talents as a software engineer in the making and fulfills the course outcomes expected.            
        </p>
        
        <p class="para2">
            The Animal Monitoring System is a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) desktop 
            application that was broken up into three segments and completed over the course 
            of three weeks. The WPF application demonstrates my abilities to design and plan 
            an engineering project that incorporates data structures and algorithms and utilizes
            an SQLite database. Each skill mentioned in the above section is visible through the
            work within this project.
